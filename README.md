# SAT-Solver-Project
Python SAT Solver (DPLL + CDCL + VSIDS) â€“ A from-scratch implementation of modern SAT solving algorithms with clause learning, non-chronological backtracking, heuristics, and visualizations.

This project is a research project SAT solver written entirely in Python, designed to explore the theory and practice of propositional satisfiability. It begins with a baseline DPLL algorithm and extends to modern techniques including unit propagation, pure literal elimination, watched literals, conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL), non-chronological backtracking, and the VSIDS heuristic used in industrial solvers.

The solver accepts DIMACS CNF files, provides detailed statistics and logs, and includes visualizations of search trees and implication graphs. A benchmarking suite compares its performance against positively known solvers such as MiniSAT and PySAT.
